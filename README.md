#### Taught by: [Tatyana Lev](https://github.com/TatyanaLev)
#### Undergraduate Student: [Julie Cao](https://github.com/juliethecao/bio-199) 

## About Bio 199 

* Independent undergraduate research project, achievable in 1 quarter
* Approved by faculty researcher, Dr. Devon Lawson
* Undergraduate mentee and Graduate student mentor meet weekly for progress check ins
* Mentee submits a final write-up at the end of the quarter
* Mentee presents in one lab meeting (20 minutes)

## Lawson Laboratory Goal: Uncover cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling breast cancer metastasis
    * Metastasis = Lethal spread of cancer cells from primary site (breast) to other organs in the body. 
    * Use mouse models and single cell genomic technology to study how intratumor heterogeneity contributes 
    to metastatic spread. Specifically, address the following questions:
        * How heterogeneous are primary tumors?
            * How many distinct cell groups, as defined by gene expression, exist in the primary tumor?
            * How are these cell groups related or how do they arise and evolve?
        * Which genes and/or regulatory regions are involved in metastasis?

## Project Overview: RNA Velocity
##### RNA velocity is a pseudotime trajectory analysis approach to uncover cellular dynamical processes such as differentiation. We will apply this method to a tumor dataset with the goals of identifiying the premalignant cells wich give rise to tumors, the tumor cell subpopulation which differentiates into the other tumor cell subpopulations including premetastatic ones.
